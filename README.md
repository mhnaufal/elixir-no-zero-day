### About Elixir

_TODO_

### 📅 Day 1 ✔️ Basic Elixir

- Print in Elixir
- Run elixir code
- Basic type
- Different between **.exs** and **.ex** file in Elixir [HERE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36292620/elixir-when-to-use-ex-and-when-exs-files)
- **.ex** get compiled while **.exs** for interpreted

### 📅 Day 2 ✔️ Data type

- In Elixir there is a data type called Atom or in other programming language called Symbol
- Atom represent a constant with the value same to the atom's name

### 📅 Day 3 ✔️List

- Lists are collection of values which may include multiple types
- Lists may also inlcude non-unique values
- Lists are immuatable by default
- Elixir list implemented as linked lists and it's blazingly fast

### 📅 Day 4 ✔️Tuple

- Elixir use curly brackets {} for defining a tuples
- Tuples are similiar to lists, but are stored contigously in memory so it makes accessing their length/indexing really fast but expensive for modification. When adding a new value, a new tuple must be created
- Tuples are immutable by default
